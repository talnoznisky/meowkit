global condition - is audio playing?
if yes, loop until any button is clicked
  if button is linked to active clip, audio is off.
  if button is linked to a different clip, audio remains on, new audio clip loops, until a button is click again. then check the above. 

add event listener to all buttons - 
  if any button is clicked, check global audio variable
    if audio = false, turn on loop linked to button that was clicked
    if audio = true, check if active loop corresponds to button that was clicked
      if active loop = click button, stop the loop and set global audio to false
      if active loop != clicked button, audio corresponding to button to loop, audio remains true
